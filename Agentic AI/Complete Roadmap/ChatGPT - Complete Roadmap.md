# Agentic AI — Complete, Structured Roadmap (curriculum-style)

_Read this like a course catalog. Each section lists **what to learn**, **why**, **recommended tools**, **practical example**, and **deliverable**._

---

## 1) Core Software Engineering & Foundations
**What:** idiomatic Python, async basics, Git, testing, Docker, HTTP, CLI tools, packaging (pip-tools), pandas / NumPy.  
**Why:** Agentic systems are full-stack software projects — strong engineering prevents fragile prototypes.  
**Tools:** Python, pytest, pip-tools, Docker, VS Code, curl/Postman.  
**Practical:** convert a notebook into a CLI training + inference script and add unit tests.  
**Deliverable:** `agent-starter` repo: tested Python package + Docker image.

---

## 2) LLM Fundamentals & Prompt Engineering
**What:** tokenization, context windows, temperature/top-p, few-shot & chain-of-thought prompting, prompt templates.  
**Why:** prompting is the cheapest and fastest lever to control agents.  
**Tools:** OpenAI Playground / local LLM REPL, LangChain prompt templates, Hugging Face tokenizers.  
**Practical:** run prompt ablation experiments; measure token cost & latency.  
**Deliverable:** notebook + README comparing prompt styles and cost/accuracy tradeoffs.

---

## 3) Embeddings, Retrieval & RAG
**What:** chunking, embedding models, nearest-neighbor retrieval, metadata filtering, hybrid search.  
**Why:** retrieval grounds agents, reduces hallucination, and enables up-to-date knowledge.  
**Tools:** FAISS (local), Pinecone/Weaviate (hosted), SentenceTransformers, Hugging Face Embeddings.  
**Practical:** ingest a PDF corpus, index, and implement QA with source citations.  
**Deliverable:** RAG demo (Hugging Face Space or Streamlit) showing citation provenance.

---

## 4) Fine-Tuning & Efficient Adaptation (PEFT / LoRA)
**What:** supervised fine-tuning, instruction tuning, LoRA/PEFT adapters, quantization, evaluation.  
**Why:** adapt base models to domain behavior with limited compute/cost.  
**Tools:** Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT, bitsandbytes, Accelerate.  
**Practical:** fine-tune a small model with LoRA on domain dialogues; compare vs prompt baseline.  
**Deliverable:** LoRA adapter + results notebook + inference script.

---

## 5) Agent Architectures & Orchestration
**What:** agent controllers, tool interfaces, memory patterns, planning vs acting, tool validation/safety.  
**Why:** agents orchestrate tools — design and isolation of tools ensure reliability and security.  
**Tools:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, Ray (parallelism), simple workflow engines.  
**Practical:** build an agent with tools: Docs search, Calculator, Calendar, Email-sender mock.  
**Deliverable:** multi-tool agent with logged tool calls and a trace UI.

---

## 6) Vector DBs, Data Pipelines & Index Management
**What:** robust ingestion (ETL), chunking strategies, index refresh policies, versioning indexes, metadata schemas.  
**Why:** production agents need fresh, consistent retrieval sources.  
**Tools:** Airflow/Prefect, Pinecone/Weaviate/FAISS, S3/MinIO.  
**Practical:** pipeline: watch folder → preprocess → embed → upsert to index.  
**Deliverable:** reproducible ETL pipeline + index snapshot + runbook.

---

## 7) Evaluation, Benchmarks & Safety
**What:** automated eval (helpfulness, accuracy), hallucination detection, red-teaming, adversarial tests, guardrails.  
**Why:** agents act autonomously — quantify and mitigate failure modes.  
**Tools:** LLM-eval frameworks, human-in-the-loop labeling, safety heuristics.  
**Practical:** create an eval suite + automated tests that fail when hallucination rate > threshold.  
**Deliverable:** evaluation report + CI test suite for model/prompts.

---

## 8) Serving Agents & APIs (Production Basics)
**What:** wrap agents as HTTP/gRPC APIs, batching, rate-limiting, auth, request tracing.  
**Why:** production requires stable, observable endpoints with SLAs.  
**Tools:** FastAPI, BentoML, Docker, Gunicorn/Uvicorn.  
**Practical:** Dockerized FastAPI service exposing `/agent` with auth + health checks.  
**Deliverable:** deployable image + API docs + simple client.

---

## 9) MLOps for Agentic Systems (CI/CD & Model Lifecycle)
**What:** experiment tracking, adapter/model registry, automated tests, gated promotion pipelines, rollback.  
**Why:** agents change quickly; safe deployment needs reproducible promotion practices.  
**Tools:** MLflow/W&B, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD/Flux (GitOps), DVC for datasets.  
**Practical:** CI: on PR run unit tests + small eval; on merge register adapter and deploy to staging.  
**Deliverable:** CI workflow + model registry + staging→prod pipeline.

---

## 10) Monitoring, Observability & Incident Response
**What:** logging tool calls, retrieval hits, latency, hallucination counters, user feedback loop, tracing.  
**Why:** detect failures, regressions, and abuse; enable safe iteration.  
**Tools:** Prometheus/Grafana, ELK/Loki, OpenTelemetry, Sentry.  
**Practical:** dashboards for requests/sec, avg latency, citation rate, hallucination alerts.  
**Deliverable:** monitoring dashboards + alert playbooks.

---

## 11) Cost, Latency & Model Economics
**What:** hybrid routing (small vs large models), quantization/distillation, batching, caching, prefetching.  
**Why:** agentic systems can be expensive; optimization enables scale.  
**Tools:** quantization libs, Redis cache, quantized runtimes.  
**Practical:** implement fallback: cheap model for short answers, LLM for complex tasks.  
**Deliverable:** cost/latency report + fallback implementation.

---

## 12) Security, Privacy & Governance
**What:** secrets/keys handling, RBAC for tools, PII detection & redaction, audit logs, privacy-preserving techniques.  
**Why:** agents access data & external tools — strong controls are mandatory.  
**Tools:** Vault/KMS, Kubernetes RBAC, OPA policy-as-code.  
**Practical:** add PII detection + redact sensitive fields before tool invocation; signed audit trail.  
**Deliverable:** security checklist + implemented redaction middleware.

---

## 13) Productization & UX for Agents
**What:** user flows, clarifying prompts, feedback UI, explainability (why the agent chose actions).  
**Why:** trust & clarity drive adoption.  
**Tools:** simple frontend (React/Streamlit), telemetry for user feedback.  
**Practical:** add an “Explain action” button to show retrieval hits and the prompt used.  
**Deliverable:** demo + UX writeup.

---

## 14) Teamwork, Processes & Documentation
**What:** RFCs, design docs, runbooks, model cards, dataset datasheets, review policies.  
**Why:** cross-functional coordination is essential for safe agent change.  
**Practical:** write an RFC to add a new tool including safety checklist.  
**Deliverable:** docs repo + PR template for agent changes.

# Compute & Budget Tips (low-cost friendly)
- Use **Colab / Kaggle** for experiments.  
- Prefer **PEFT / LoRA + 4-bit quantization** to fine-tune on modest GPUs.  
- Use local FAISS for dev; hosted vector DBs only for demos.  
- Cache embeddings & responses to cut API/compute calls.

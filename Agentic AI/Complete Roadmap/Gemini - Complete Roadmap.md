- **Deliverable**: A simple API endpoint that performs semantic search over a vector store containing 10,000+ documents.

### 7. Evaluation & Safety
- **What**: Measuring agent performance with metrics (e.g., faithfulness, answer relevancy) and implementing safety guardrails.
- **Why**: To build agents that are reliable, trustworthy, and safe from misuse or harmful outputs.
- **Recommended Tools**: `Ragas`, `UpTrain`, `NeMo Guardrails`, `LlamaGuard`.
- **Practical example**: Evaluate a RAG system's responses against a ground-truth Q&A set to measure its accuracy.
- **Deliverable**: A report comparing two versions of an agent (e.g., with different prompts), including quantitative evaluation scores.

### 8. Serving & APIs
- **What**: Exposing your agent's functionality to the world through a robust web server API.
- **Why**: To allow other applications (web, mobile) to integrate with and use your agent.
- **Recommended Tools**: `FastAPI`, `Flask`, `Docker`.
- **Practical example**: Wrap a LangChain agent in a FastAPI endpoint that accepts a JSON request with a query and returns a JSON response.
- **Deliverable**: A containerized REST API for your research assistant agent, ready for deployment.

### 9. MLOps for Agents
- **What**: Applying DevOps principles like CI/CD, experiment tracking, and data/model versioning to agent development.
- **Why**: To create a reproducible, automated, and maintainable workflow for improving your agents.
- **Recommended Tools**: `GitHub Actions`, `MLflow`, `Weights & Biases`.
- **Practical example**: Set up a GitHub Action that automatically runs an evaluation suite whenever you update a prompt template.
- **Deliverable**: A project repository with a CI pipeline that runs tests and evaluations on every code push.

### 10. Monitoring & Observability
- **What**: Tracking agent behavior, latency, costs, and errors in a live environment.
- **Why**: To understand how users interact with your agent, debug issues quickly, and identify areas for improvement.
- **Recommended Tools**: `Langfuse`, `Arize AI`, `OpenTelemetry`.
- **Practical example**: Integrate Langfuse to get a detailed trace of an agent's execution, showing each thought, tool call, and LLM interaction.
- **Deliverable**: A dashboard showing key performance indicators (KPIs) like latency, token count, and error rate for your agent's API.

### 11. Cost/Latency & Model Economics
- **What**: Analyzing and optimizing token usage, model selection, and infrastructure choices to manage expenses and performance.
- **Why**: To ensure your agent is economically viable and provides a responsive user experience.
- **Recommended Tools**: `LiteLLM` (for provider abstraction), `Tiktoken` (for token counting), cloud provider cost calculators.
- **Practical example**: Compare the cost-per-query and response time of using GPT-4-Turbo vs. a locally-hosted Llama 3 model for a specific task.
- **Deliverable**: A cost analysis spreadsheet projecting the monthly operational cost of an agent based on expected usage patterns.

### 12. Security/Privacy/Governance
- **What**: Implementing defenses against attacks like prompt injection, ensuring user data privacy, and adhering to responsible AI principles.
- **Why**: To build secure and compliant agents that protect user data and prevent malicious exploitation.
- **Recommended Tools**: `Rebuff.ai`, `NeMo Guardrails`, data anonymization libraries (e.g., `presidio`).
- **Practical example**: Implement a system prompt and an input validation layer to block common prompt injection attempts.
- **Deliverable**: A document outlining the security measures for an agent, including defenses against the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs.

### 13. Productization & UX

# Agentic AI — Practical Learning Sequence (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)

Progressive path to agentic AI mastery, tailored for beginners with 10 hrs/week and low budget.

## Beginner Phase (4–8 weeks)
1. **What**: Master Python basics and Git.
   **Why**: Builds coding foundation for all agent work.
2. **What**: Explore LLM APIs and simple prompting.
   **Why**: Introduces core interaction with AI models.
3. **What**: Set up free dev environment.
   **Why**: Enables hands-on practice without cost.
Phase Deliverable: Basic prompt-based script in a Git repo.

## Intermediate Phase (8–12 weeks)
1. **What**: Dive into embeddings and basic RAG.
   **Why**: Enhances agent knowledge retrieval.
2. **What**: Learn agent architectures like ReAct.
   **Why**: Teaches planning and execution.
3. **What**: Experiment with vector DBs.
   **Why**: Scales data handling for agents.
4. **What**: Basic fine-tuning on free platforms.
   **Why**: Customizes models efficiently.
Phase Deliverable: Simple RAG agent prototype.

## Advanced Phase (12+ weeks)
1. **What**: Implement multi-agent systems.
   **Why**: Handles complex, collaborative tasks.
2. **What**: Focus on evaluation, safety, and MLOps.
   **Why**: Ensures production-ready agents.
3. **What**: Optimize for cost, security, and UX.
   **Why**: Prepares for real-world deployment.
4. **What**: Build and document team processes.
   **Why**: Simulates professional environments.
Phase Deliverable: End-to-end agent product with docs.

## 90-Day Example Plan
- Days 1–30: Python/LLM basics, weekly scripts (10 hrs/week).
- Days 31–60: RAG/agent builds, mid-project prototypes.
- Days 61–90: Advanced optimizations, final portfolio projects.

## Deliverables to Show Employers
- GitHub repo with agent projects.
- Deployed agent demo (e.g., via Streamlit).
- Evaluation reports on agent performance.
- Blog post on an agent build process.
- Custom fine-tuned model on Hugging Face.

Why this sequence: Builds from foundations to advanced applications, ensuring steady progress with limited time/budget.

# Agentic AI — Practical Learning Sequence (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)

_This is a step-by-step learning sequence split into three phases. Each phase lists ordered steps, why they come in that order, durations, and deliverables._

---

## Beginner (foundation) — goal: coding, ML basics, reproducibility  
**Suggested duration:** 4–8 weeks

1. **Python engineering** — packages, venvs, pip-tools, type hints, small scripts.  
   *Why:* base for everything.  
2. **Git & workflows** — branching, PRs, merge conflicts.  
   *Why:* reproducibility & collaboration.  
3. **Testing & linting** — pytest, unit tests for data transforms, black/flake8.  
   *Why:* prevents regressions and teaches modular design.  
4. **Small FastAPI service + Dockerize** — simple API exposing a model call.  
   *Why:* packaging and serving basics.  
5. **LLM playground & prompt experiments** — tokens, temperature, few-shot.  
   *Why:* cheap, immediate model control.  
6. **Simple embeddings + FAISS demo** — index a few docs and query.  
   *Why:* retrieval fundamentals.

**Deliverable (end of phase):** Dockerized mini-service that answers with retrieved citations and a short README.

---

## Intermediate (production basics) — goal: agent prototypes & pipelines  
**Suggested duration:** 8–12 weeks

1. **RAG app** — chunking, metadata, citation formatting, small UI (Streamlit/HF Space).  
2. **LangChain basics** — chains, tools, simple agent calling one tool.  
3. **PEFT / LoRA primer** — fine-tune small dataset, save adapter, load adapter at inference.  
4. **Wrap agent behind API** — add auth, health checks, Docker image.  
5. **ETL / ingestion pipeline** — Airflow/Prefect job to refresh index.  
6. **Basic monitoring & logging** — structured logs + simple metrics (latency, retrieval hits).

**Deliverable (end of phase):** multi-tool agent accessible via API + ingestion pipeline + basic monitoring.

---

## Advanced (scale, governance, harden) — goal: production maturity  
**Suggested duration:** 12+ weeks (ongoing)

1. **Automated eval & safety suite + CI gating** — regression tests, hallucination thresholds.  
2. **Monitoring, tracing & alerting** — Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry.  
3. **Cost & latency optimizations** — quantization, hybrid routing, caching.  
4. **Security & governance** — RBAC, secrets, audit trails, privacy protections.  
5. **Full CI/CD for model lifecycle** — model registry, gated promotions, rollback.  
6. **Feature store & online features** (if needed) — Feast or equivalent.  
7. **Adversarial robustness & explainability** — bias audits, SHAP/Alibi.

**Deliverable (ongoing):** production-grade agent with monitoring, governance, and CI/CD.

## Compact 90-Day Example Plan
- **Days 1–14:** Set up dev env, Dockerized API, LLM prompt experiments.  
- **Days 15–30:** Build FAISS RAG prototype + simple UI.  
- **Days 31–50:** Add LangChain agent with 2 tools + conversational memory.  
- **Days 51–70:** Implement LoRA adapter for domain data + compare to prompt baseline.  
- **Days 71–90:** Wrap agent in FastAPI, add basic monitoring + CI tests, deploy demo.

---

## Deliverables to show employers
- 2 polished demos (RAG assistant + multi-tool agent) with README & short video/GIF.  
- Architecture diagram and one-page system design for each demo.  
- CI/CD logs showing tests & gated deployment for a model update.  
- Short evaluation report (hallucination rate, citation coverage, cost per request).

---

## Why this sequence?
Start with engineering & reproducibility so model work scales cleanly. Add retrieval & orchestration next because they’re essential for grounded autonomous behavior. Harden last: monitoring, governance, and cost controls are what make agentic systems safe and deployable.

**Quick checklist (end state):**
- RAG + citations ✔  
- LoRA adapter in use ✔  
- LangChain multi-tool agent deployed behind API ✔  
- Monitoring, eval suite, and CI gating in place ✔

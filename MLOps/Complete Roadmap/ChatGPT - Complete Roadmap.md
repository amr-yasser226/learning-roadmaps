# Complete, Structured MLOps Roadmap

Nice — I like this. Below is a **complete, structured MLOps roadmap** you can follow as a learning plan. I organized it into the exact categories you asked for and included **concrete tools, frameworks, and practical examples** in each section. Read it like a curriculum: learn core foundations first, then layer the ML + infra + ops skills, and then practice end-to-end projects.

# Core programming and software engineering foundations
- **Languages & idioms**
  - Python (primary): idiomatic Python, virtual environments, packaging (pip, `pip-tools`, `setuptools`), type hints.
  - Bash / basic shell scripting.
  - Optional: a second language (Go/Java/Scala) for infra tooling.
- **Software engineering practices**
  - Version control with Git (branching strategies: trunk, feature branches).
  - Code review + unit testing (pytest), integration tests, test doubles.
  - Linting & formatting: `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`.
  - Design patterns for modular ML code: clear separation of data, model, training, and serving logic.
- **Project structure & reproducibility**
  - Project layout for small–large models, reproducible experiment runs (CLI entrypoints).
  - Dependency management: `pip-tools` (you said you prefer this), `conda`, `poetry` (know at least one alternative).
  - Example task: convert a Jupyter notebook into a repeatable training script and add unit tests.

# Machine learning fundamentals
- **Core concepts**
  - Supervised/unsupervised learning, loss functions, optimization, overfitting, regularization, cross-validation.
  - Evaluation metrics (classification/regression/ ranking), calibration, uncertainty.
  - Feature engineering, feature drift, data leakage.
- **Frameworks & libraries**
  - `scikit-learn` for classical ML.
  - `PyTorch` (and `torchvision`), `TensorFlow` / Keras for deep learning.
  - `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `CatBoost` for tree ensembles.
- **Practical examples**
  - Build a binary classifier from CSV → preprocess → train → evaluate → save model artifact (pickle/ONNX).
  - Convert a trained PyTorch model to TorchScript / ONNX and run inference in a small Flask app.

# Data engineering and pipeline design
- **Data ingestion & storage**
  - SQL (Postgres, MySQL) + OLAP stores (ClickHouse, BigQuery).
  - Object stores: S3 / MinIO for raw/processed data and model artifacts.
  - Streaming: Kafka / Pulsar for real-time pipelines.
- **ETL / orchestration**
  - Batch: Apache Airflow, Prefect (flow orchestration), Dagster.
  - Streaming / micro-batches: Kafka Streams, Flink (basics).
  - Data transformation: `dbt` for analytics-style transformations.
- **Feature stores & data validation**
  - Feature store concepts: online vs offline features (Feast example).
  - Data validation & testing: `great_expectations`.
- **Practical example**
  - Build a reproducible pipeline: raw CSV → Airflow/Prefect DAG → transform with Pandas/Spark → write features to S3 and register metadata.

# Containerization, orchestration, and deployment
- **Container basics**
  - Docker (build, tag, push images) — multi-stage builds for smaller images.
  - Alternatives: Podman.
- **Orchestration**
  - Kubernetes fundamentals: Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets.
  - Managed K8s: EKS / GKE / AKS.
- **Packaging & deployment tooling**
  - Helm charts, Kustomize for declarative deployments.
  - Image registries: Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, ACR.
- **Practical examples**
  - Containerize a model server (Flask/BentoML/TorchServe) and deploy to a k8s cluster with a Helm chart + horizontal pod autoscaling.

# CI/CD for ML models
- **Principles**
  - Repeatable pipelines that run tests, build images, run training/inference smoke tests, and deploy artifacts.
  - Separate orchestration for code CI and model/CD (training pipelines vs serving).
- **CI tools**
  - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI.
- **CD & GitOps**
  - ArgoCD, Flux, or Tekton for declarative CD and GitOps flows.
- **Practical pipeline example**
  - Git push → GitHub Actions:
    1. Run unit tests & linters.
    2. Run small smoke integration (train on sample data).
    3. Build Docker image and push to registry.
    4. Trigger image deployment via ArgoCD / update Kubernetes image tag.
- **ML-specific**
  - Automate model packaging (MLflow model, BentoML bundle) and include reproducibility hashes (git SHA, dataset version).

# Model serving and scaling strategies
- **Serving patterns**
  - Batch inference (Airflow / batch jobs).
  - Online REST/gRPC APIs for low-latency.
  - Asynchronous / message-based pipelines for high throughput.
- **Serving frameworks**
  - TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, NVIDIA Triton (high-performance inference).
  - BentoML, MLflow Models, Seldon Core, KServe (KFServing).
- **Scaling options**
  - Horizontal pod autoscaling, model sharding, GPU autoscaling (Cluster Autoscaler).
  - Use specialized inference hardware: GPUs, TPUs, or inference accelerators.
- **Practical example**
  - Deploy a model in BentoML as a REST endpoint, add a k8s HPA (based on request rate), and run a load test with `wrk` or `locust`.

# Monitoring, logging, and observability for ML in production
- **Metrics & logging**
  - Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (dashboards).
  - Centralized logging: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki + Grafana.
  - Tracing: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger.
- **Model-specific monitoring**
  - Data drift & concept drift: detect feature distribution shifts and label drift.
  - Performance regression: track inference latency, error rates, throughput.
  - Prediction correctness: online labeling, sample audits.
- **Open-source / commercial tools**
  - WhyLabs, Evidently, Fiddler, Arize AI (commercial options).
  - Seldon Analytics, Alibi Detect for explainability and drift detection.
- **Practical example**
  - Emit inference metrics from your service to Prometheus, create Grafana panels for latency & request rates; add a drift detector that alerts when a feature’s distribution diverges.

# Model versioning and governance
- **Model & experiment tracking**
  - MLflow (tracking + model registry), Weights & Biases, Neptune.
  - Store experiment metadata: hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts, git SHA.
- **Data & code versioning**
  - DVC (data + model versioning), Git LFS, or Pachyderm for data lineage.
- **Metadata & lineage**
  - OpenLineage / Marquez for lineage capture; model cards and dataset datasheets for transparency.
- **Governance practices**
  - Model registry workflows: staging → validation → production; automated tests before stage transition.
  - Model cards, reproducibility artifacts (training config, data snapshot, environment).
- **Practical example**
  - Use DVC to version datasets & MLflow to log experiments and register promoted models, with a PR-based gating policy that prevents registry promotion without tests.

# Security, compliance, and best practices
- **Authentication & secrets**
  - IAM principles (least privilege), role-based access control (RBAC) for clusters.
  - Secrets management: HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets (with KMS encryption), cloud KMS.
- **Data privacy & compliance**
  - PII handling: tokenization/anonymization, retention policies.
  - Understand GDPR/CCPA basics and data residency constraints.
- **Container & dependency security**
  - Image scanning: Trivy, Clair; vulnerability scanning and SCA (Snyk, Dependabot).
  - Runtime security: Pod security policies, network policies.
- **ML-specific risks**
  - Adversarial robustness, model inversion & membership inference defenses, bias audits, explainability.
- **Practical checklist**
  - Enforce signed commits or CI checks, scan built images, encrypt data at rest & transit, audit logs for access.

# Cloud platforms and managed ML services
- **Major clouds & managed offerings**
  - AWS: SageMaker, EKS, S3, CodePipeline, ECR.
  - GCP: Vertex AI, GKE, Cloud Storage, Cloud Build.
  - Azure: Azure ML, AKS, Blob Storage, DevOps pipelines.
- **When to use managed vs self-managed**
  - Managed (SageMaker/Vertex): faster iteration and built-in features (autopilot, model registry).
  - Self-managed (k8s + open-source): more flexibility and lower long-term cost at scale.
- **Hybrid & multi-cloud**
  - Containerize workloads to ease portability; use Terraform for infra-as-code.
- **Practical example**
  - Deploy a model to Cloud Run or SageMaker endpoint as a proof-of-concept; compare cost/management tradeoffs.

# Collaboration, communication, and team workflows
- **Team processes**
  - Agile rituals adapted to ML: experiment triage, model review meetings, reproducibility checkpoints.
  - RFCs/design docs for new model features or infra changes.
- **Reproducibility & handoff**
  - Use MLflow/DVC artifacts + runbooks to hand models to SRE or product teams.
  - Clear SLOs/SLAs for model endpoints and runbooks for rollback.
- **Documentation & knowledge sharing**
  - Model cards, READMEs, runbooks, onboarding checklists.
  - Use issue templates and PR templates to enforce testing & experiments logging.
- **Practical example**
  - Implement a gating policy: PR must include reproducible run artifacts (MLflow run id + DVC commit) and tests before merging a model change.

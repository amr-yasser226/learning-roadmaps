# Practical Learning Sequence for MLOps

This sequence organizes the MLOps roadmap into a clear learning path, divided into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced** phases. Each phase lists the skills and topics in the recommended order, with explanations of why the sequence matters and how each step builds on the previous one.

---

## Beginner Phase

**Focus**: Build foundational skills in programming, machine learning, and data handling.  
**Why**: These core skills are essential before tackling MLOps. You need to code, understand ML, and manage data to work with machine learning systems effectively.

1. **Core Programming and Software Engineering Foundations**
    
    - **Topics**: Python programming, version control (Git), testing (unit/integration), design principles (SOLID, DRY).
    - **Why First**: Programming is the starting point for all MLOps tasks. Git enables collaboration, testing ensures reliability, and design principles help create maintainable systems.
    - **Builds On**: N/A (entry-level skill).
2. **Machine Learning Fundamentals**
    
    - **Topics**: Supervised/unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning.
    - **Why Next**: You need to know how ML models are built and evaluated before deploying them in production.
    - **Builds On**: Programming skills (writing ML code in Python).
3. **Data Engineering Basics**
    
    - **Topics**: Handling large datasets (Pandas, Dask), ETL pipelines, databases (SQL/NoSQL), data versioning (DVC).
    - **Why Next**: ML depends on data. This step teaches you to process and manage data, ensuring models have reliable inputs.
    - **Builds On**: Programming and ML fundamentals (manipulating data for ML workflows).

## Intermediate Phase

**Focus**: Learn to deploy, automate, and scale ML models using modern tools and practices.  
**Why**: After building models, you need to productionize them. This phase bridges development and operations with deployment and automation skills.

1. **Containerization and Orchestration**
    
    - **Topics**: Docker, Kubernetes, deployment strategies (blue-green, canary).
    - **Why First**: Containers package models and dependencies for consistency, while orchestration scales them across systems.
    - **Builds On**: Programming and data engineering (packaging code and managing runtime environments).
2. **CI/CD for ML Models**
    
    - **Topics**: Automation tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), ML-specific CI/CD (MLflow, Kubeflow), model testing (Great Expectations).
    - **Why Next**: CI/CD automates model deployment and updates, making the process efficient and repeatable.
    - **Builds On**: Containerization (automating containerized model deployments).
3. **Model Serving and Scaling Strategies**
    
    - **Topics**: Serving models via APIs (Flask, FastAPI), batch processing, scaling techniques (horizontal scaling, load balancing).
    - **Why Next**: Models must be accessible and performant in production, handling real-world traffic.
    - **Builds On**: CI/CD and containerization (serving and scaling deployed models).

## Advanced Phase

**Focus**: Master maintaining, securing, and optimizing ML systems in production.  
**Why**: This phase ensures long-term success by addressing monitoring, governance, security, and teamworkâ€”critical for real-world MLOps.

1. **Monitoring, Logging, and Observability for ML in Production**
    
    - **Topics**: Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), logging (ELK stack), drift detection (Evidently).
    - **Why First**: Production models need constant oversight to catch issues like performance degradation or data drift.
    - **Builds On**: Model serving and scaling (tracking live model performance).
2. **Model Versioning and Governance**
    
    - **Topics**: Experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases), model management (ModelDB), governance frameworks.
    - **Why Next**: Versioning and governance ensure models are reproducible and compliant as they evolve.
    - **Builds On**: CI/CD and monitoring (managing model iterations and standards).
3. **Security, Compliance, and Best Practices**
    
    - **Topics**: Data privacy (differential privacy), model security (adversarial attacks), compliance (GDPR), best practices (code quality, documentation).
    - **Why Next**: Security and compliance protect production systems, especially in regulated settings.
    - **Builds On**: Governance and monitoring (securing and regulating monitored models).
4. **Cloud Platforms and Managed ML Services**
    
    - **Topics**: AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure ML, cost optimization.
    - **Why Next**: Cloud tools simplify scaling and managing ML workflows with pre-built services.
    - **Builds On**: All previous skills (leveraging cloud for deployment, monitoring, and optimization).
5. **Collaboration, Communication, and Team Workflows**
    
    - **Topics**: Collaborative coding (Git), project management (Jira), communication tools (Slack), Agile methodologies.
    - **Why Last**: MLOps requires teamwork. This step ties everything together for effective delivery.
    - **Builds On**: All previous phases (collaborating on production ML systems).

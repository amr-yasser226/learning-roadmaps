# Practical Learning Sequence (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)

Nice — I’ll convert that roadmap into a **practical learning sequence** split into three phases: **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**. Each phase lists the steps in the order you should learn them, with a short “why this order” note so you see how each skill builds on previous work.

# Beginner (foundation) — goal: build solid coding, ML basics, and reproducibility habits  
**Suggested duration:** 4–8 weeks

1. **Python & software engineering basics**
   - *What:* Python idioms, virtualenvs, packaging (`pip-tools`), shell basics, simple scripting.
   - *Why first:* Everything else (experiments, infra, CI) depends on clean, reproducible code.

2. **Git & version control workflow**
   - *What:* Git, branching, commits, PRs, basic merge conflicts.
   - *Why next:* Enables collaboration & reproducible experiment tracing.

3. **Testing, linting, and project structure**
   - *What:* `pytest`, unit tests for data transforms, `black`/`flake8`, type hints.
   - *Why:* Prevents regressions and teaches modular code design used throughout MLOps.

4. **Core ML fundamentals**
   - *What:* Supervised learning basics, cross-validation, evaluation metrics, simple scikit-learn models.
   - *Why:* You must understand model behavior and metrics before productionizing models.

5. **Experiment tracking & reproducibility**
   - *What:* MLflow (tracking runs), saving artifacts, reproducible scripts (no-notebook pipelines).
   - *Why:* Teaches how to capture what you ran — crucial for later model registry and CI.

6. **Simple end-to-end mini project**
   - *What:* CSV → preprocess → train → MLflow log → save model artifact.
   - *Why:* Reinforces the previous steps in a small, repeatable loop.

# Intermediate (production basics) — goal: automation, packaging, infra basics  
**Suggested duration:** 8–12 weeks

1. **Data engineering & ETL basics**
   - *What:* SQL, Pandas + small Spark intro, S3/object storage concepts, data validation (`great_expectations`).
   - *Why:* Clean, validated data is required for reliable models in production.

2. **DVC or dataset versioning**
   - *What:* Track datasets and model binaries (DVC/Git LFS workflow).
   - *Why:* Enables reproducible dataset snapshots used by CI and registry flows.

3. **Containerization**
   - *What:* Docker: images, multi-stage builds, tags.
   - *Why:* Packaging models and services consistently for deployment.

4. **Simple model serving**
   - *What:* Serve model via Flask/BentoML or MLflow Models locally; create a REST endpoint.
   - *Why:* Bridges model training and real-world inference; surfaces latency/serialization issues.

5. **CI basics for ML code**
   - *What:* GitHub Actions / GitLab CI to run linters, tests, build & push images.
   - *Why:* Automates quality checks and creates deployable artifacts.

6. **Orchestration for pipelines**
   - *What:* Airflow / Prefect simple DAGs to schedule ETL & batch inference.
   - *Why:* Introduces automation of data and retraining workflows.

7. **Monitoring & logging (basic)**
   - *What:* Add structured logs, Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards for the service.
   - *Why:* Observability is essential to know when things break or drift.

8. **Project: End-to-end (Project A)**
   - *What:* Dataset tracked with DVC + MLflow experiments → Dockerized model → CI build → deploy to Cloud Run / small k8s cluster → basic monitoring.
   - *Why:* Combines all intermediate skills in a deployable pipeline.

# Advanced (scale, governance, robustness) — goal: production-grade MLOps at scale  
**Suggested duration:** 12+ weeks (ongoing)

1. **Kubernetes & production orchestration**
   - *What:* k8s concepts, Helm, autoscaling (HPA), deployment strategies (canary/blue-green).
   - *Why:* Production-grade deployment, scaling, and resilience require orchestration.

2. **Advanced model serving & inference optimization**
   - *What:* Triton / TorchServe, batching, model quantization, GPU autoscaling.
   - *Why:* Improve throughput/latency and cost efficiency for real workloads.

3. **Feature stores & online features**
   - *What:* Feast or equivalent; offline vs online features, consistency strategies.
   - *Why:* Ensures serving uses the same features as training at scale.

4. **Model registry, governance & lineage**
   - *What:* MLflow Model Registry or managed equivalents; OpenLineage/Marquez; model cards.
   - *Why:* Formalizes promotion pipelines, reproducibility, approvals, and audits.

5. **Drift detection & ML monitoring (advanced)**
   - *What:* Data drift, concept drift detection (Evidently/WhyLabs), alerting, automated retrain triggers.
   - *Why:* Keeps models reliable over time and reduces silent performance decay.

6. **Security, privacy & compliance**
   - *What:* Secrets management (Vault/KMS), RBAC, PII handling, GDPR basics, image scanning.
   - *Why:* Protects data, infrastructure, and meets legal/enterprise requirements.

7. **CI/CD for full ML lifecycle & GitOps**
   - *What:* ArgoCD/Flux, Tekton pipelines, model gating policies, automated promotion with tests.
   - *Why:* Ensures safe, auditable, automated promotions from dev → staging → prod.

8. **Observability, tracing & SLO/SLA design**
   - *What:* Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry/Jaeger), SLOs for latency/accuracy, incident runbooks.
   - *Why:* Operational maturity requires defined service quality targets and traceability.

9. **Robustness & adversarial considerations**
   - *What:* Bias audits, adversarial testing, explainability tooling (SHAP/Alibi), privacy-preserving techniques.
   - *Why:* Ensures models are fair, interpretable, and resilient to attacks/abuse.

10. **Advanced project (scalable production)**
    - *What:* Deploy a feature-store-backed model with online serving on k8s, autoscaling GPUs, model registry promotions, drift detection + automated retrain pipeline.
    - *Why:* Demonstrates end-to-end production readiness and governance.

# Why this sequence matters (short summary)
- **Start small, reproducible, and tested.** Foundations (clean code + ML basics) reduce wasted effort and technical debt.
- **Automate and package next.** Containers, CI, and simple orchestration turn manual experiments into reproducible artifacts you can deploy.
- **Scale and govern last.** Once you can reliably build & deploy, add orchestration, monitoring, governance, and security to operate at scale safely.

# Suggested pacing & deliverables
- **First 3 months (Beginner → start Intermediate):** deliver 1 polished end-to-end project (Project A) with MLflow + DVC, Dockerfile, and CI.
- **Next 3 months (Finish Intermediate → start Advanced):** deploy to k8s or managed cloud (SageMaker/Vertex), add basic monitoring and an Airflow/Prefect pipeline.
- **Months 7–12+:** tackle advanced features — feature store, model registry workflows, autoscaling, governance, and security hardening.

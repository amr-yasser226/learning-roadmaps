# MLOps Learning Sequence: A Phased Approach

This learning plan is designed to take you from foundational knowledge to production-ready expertise in a step-by-step manner, ensuring each new skill builds upon the last.

---

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Beginner)

**Goal:** To build a solid base in programming, version control, and core machine learning concepts. This phase is about creating a functional, standalone ML application on your local machine.

**Why this sequence matters:** You need to learn the language (Python), how to manage your work (Git), and what you're working with (ML models) before you can think about automating or deploying them. Each step provides a necessary building block for the next.

1.  **Core Python & Command Line:** This is your starting point. You cannot build, automate, or deploy anything without being proficient in your primary language and comfortable in the terminal.
    * **Focus on:** Python syntax, data structures, functions, and key libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**. Learn basic **Bash** commands for navigation and file manipulation.

2.  **Git & Version Control:** As soon as you write your first script, start using Git. This is a non-negotiable professional habit. It teaches you how to manage code, collaborate, and revert mistakes.
    * **Focus on:** `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `branch`, and `merge`. Create a **GitHub** account and manage all your learning projects there.

3.  **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** With programming skills in hand, you can now understand and build the "ML" part of MLOps. This knowledge prevents you from treating models as pure black boxes.
    * **Focus on:** Using **Scikit-learn** to train and evaluate simple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest). Understand the difference between training, validation, and testing, and grasp key evaluation metrics.

4.  **Building a Basic Model API:** This is the capstone of the foundation phase. It makes your model useful by exposing it as a service. This step solidifies your Python skills and introduces the concept of a model as a software component.
    * **Focus on:** Using **FastAPI** to wrap your trained Scikit-learn model in a REST API with a `/predict` endpoint. Test it locally.

### Phase 2: Building the MLOps Core (Intermediate)

**Goal:** To automate the process of building, testing, and packaging your ML application. This is where you connect the "Dev" and "ML" fundamentals with "Ops" practices.

**Why this sequence matters:** This phase is about creating reproducible and automated workflows. You first package your application into a portable unit (Docker), then automate its creation (CI/CD), and finally, build robust pipelines for the data and models it depends on.

1.  **Containerization with Docker:** Now that you have a local API, you need to make it portable and environment-agnostic. Docker is the industry standard for this.
    * **Focus on:** Writing a `Dockerfile` for your FastAPI application. Learn to build an image, run a container, and push your image to a registry like **Docker Hub**.

2.  **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** With a containerized application, the next step is to automate the testing and building process. This introduces you to the core of DevOps automation.
    * **Focus on:** Creating a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) that automatically runs **pytest** on your code and builds your Docker image every time you push to your repository.

3.  **Data & Training Pipelines (Orchestration):** Your CI/CD pipeline handles application code, but MLOps requires pipelines for data and model training. This step automates the ML-specific parts of the lifecycle.
    * **Focus on:** Using a tool like **Apache Airflow** or **Prefect** to create a simple, scheduled pipeline that fetches data, processes it, and trains a model.

4.  **Experiment Tracking & Model Versioning:** As you automate training, you'll generate many models. You need a system to manage this complexity and ensure reproducibility.
    * **Focus on:** Integrating **MLflow** into your training pipeline. Use it to log parameters, metrics, and the trained model artifact for every run. Explore the MLflow Model Registry to version your models. Use **DVC** for versioning your data.

### Phase 3: Production-Grade MLOps (Advanced)

**Goal:** To deploy, scale, monitor, and manage ML systems in a production environment. This is where you graduate from building pipelines to operating resilient, enterprise-level systems.

**Why this sequence matters:** This phase simulates a real-world production environment. You first need a platform to run services at scale (Kubernetes), then specialized tools to serve models on it. Once deployed, you absolutely must monitor the system. Finally, you learn to manage the entire infrastructure as code and master the cloud platforms where this all runs.

1.  **Container Orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s):** Docker runs one container; Kubernetes runs thousands. To deploy for real-world traffic, you must learn to orchestrate your containers.
    * **Focus on:** Understanding core concepts like `Pods`, `Deployments`, and `Services`. Learn to deploy your containerized model API to a local (Minikube) or cloud Kubernetes cluster.

2.  **Advanced Model Serving & Scaling:** While you can use a simple K8s Deployment, specialized serving tools provide critical features like autoscaling, canary rollouts, and A/B testing out of the box.
    * **Focus on:** Deploying your model using **KServe** or **Seldon Core** on top of your Kubernetes cluster.

3.  **Monitoring & Observability:** A deployed model that isn't monitored is a liability. This is a critical step for ensuring reliability and detecting degradation.
    * **Focus on:** Setting up **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor your API's latency and resource usage. Use a tool like **Evidently AI** to create a dashboard that monitors your model for **data drift**.

4.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Security:** Manually setting up this complex infrastructure is slow and error-prone. IaC allows you to define and manage your entire stack through code.
    * **Focus on:** Using **Terraform** to define your Kubernetes cluster, monitoring stack, and deployments. Learn to manage secrets with **HashiCorp Vault** or a cloud equivalent.

5.  **Mastering a Cloud Platform:** Finally, tie all these concepts together within a major cloud ecosystem. Managed services can significantly accelerate your workflow.
    * **Focus on:** Re-implementing your end-to-end pipeline using the managed services of **AWS (SageMaker)**, **GCP (Vertex AI)**, or **Azure (Azure Machine Learning)**. This demonstrates your ability to apply MLOps principles in a real commercial environment.

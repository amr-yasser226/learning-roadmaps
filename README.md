# Learning Roadmaps Hub

A simple repository collecting concise learning and career roadmaps for topics you care about (for example: MLOps, .NET, Flask, MLflow).

## What this repo is for

* Provide short, practical roadmaps (one-page or short guides) that anyone can follow to learn a topic.
* Store each roadmap as an easy-to-read file (Markdown or PDF).
* Let contributors add or improve roadmaps quickly with minimal overhead.

## How to contribute (quick)

1. Create a file named `NN-topic-name.md` or `NN-topic-name.pdf` (use a numeric prefix if you want natural sorting).
2. Add a short summary and prerequisites at the top of the file.
3. Open a pull request or an issue describing your roadmap.
